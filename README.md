# Overview
A command line utility for combining two DCS World missions together.

# Features
* Currently this tool does one thing:  It moves all the client flights from one mission into another.
  * This can be useful for mission devs who add lots of client flights to their missions.  You can work on the static groups/air defences or whatever, then bring in all the client flights afterward.
